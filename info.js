// 1. I have created this project to showcase my skills regarding Front-end Development.
// 2. Although the instructions given in assessment were not very much explanatory,
//    this project has been created using React only (no back-end or Database involved).
// 3. However the list of products generated using CRUD operations may be stored in
//    localStorage to avoid loss of data on page reload.

// THANK YOU
// in this app, final list will reset to 0 as the page reloads.
// this can be prevented using localStorage

//thanks
